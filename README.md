# RAG Experiment Accelerator

## Overview

The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is a versatile tool that helps you conduct experiments and evaluations using Azure AI Search and RAG pattern. This document provides a comprehensive guide that covers everything you need to know about this tool, such as its purpose, features, installation, usage, and more.

## Purpose

The main goal of the **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is to make it easier and faster to run experiments and evaluations of search queries and quality of response from OpenAI. This tool is useful for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to:

- Test the performance of different Search and OpenAI related hyperparameters.
- Compare the effectiveness of various search strategies.
- Fine-tune and optimize parameters.
- Find the best combination of hyperparameters.
- Generate detailed reports and visualizations from experiment results.

## Latest changes

18 March 2024 - Content sampling has been added. This functionality will allow the dataset to be sampled by a specified percentage. The data is clustered by content and then the sample percentage is taken across each cluster to attempt even distribution of the sampled data.

This is done to ensure representative results in the sample that one would get across the entire dataset.

**Note**: It is recommended to rebuild your environment if you have used this tool before due to new dependencies.

## Features

The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is config driven and offers a rich set of features to support its purpose:

1. **Experiment Setup**: You can define and configure experiments by specifying a range of search engine parameters, search types, query sets, and evaluation metrics.

1. **Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with Azure AI Search, Azure Machine Learning, MLFlow and Azure OpenAI.

1. **Rich Search Index**: It creates multiple search indexes based on hyperparameter configurations available in the config file.

1. **Multiple Document Chunking Strategies**: The tool supports multiple chunking strategies, including using Azure Document Intelligence and basic chunking using LangChain. This gives you the flexibility to experiment with different chunking strategies and evaluate their effectiveness.

1. **Custom Document Intelligence Loader** : When selecting the 'prebuilt-layout' API model for Document Intelligence, the tool utilizes a custom Document Intelligence loader to load the data. This custom loader supports formatting of tables into key-value pairs (to enhance readability for the LLM), excludes irrelevant parts of the file for the LLM (such as page numbers and footers), removes recurring patterns in the file using regex, and more. The custom loader resorts to the simpler 'prebuilt-layout' API model as a fallback when the 'prebuilt-layout' fails. Any other API model will utilize LangChain's implementation, which returns the raw response from Document Intelligence's API.

1. **Query Generation**: The tool can generate a variety of diverse and customizable query sets, which can be tailored for specific experimentation needs.

1. **Multiple Search Types**: It supports multiple search types, including pure text, pure vector, cross-vector, multi-vector, hybrid, and more. This gives you the ability to conduct comprehensive analysis on search capabilities and results.

1. **Sub-Querying**: The pattern evaluates the user query and if it finds it complex enough, it breaks it down into smaller sub-queries to generate relevant context.

1. **Re-Ranking**: The query responses from Azure AI Search are re-evaluated using LLM and ranked according to the relevance between the query and the context.

1. **Metrics and Evaluation**: You can define custom evaluation metrics, which enable precise and granular assessment of search algorithm performance. It includes distance-based, cosine, semantic similarity, and more metrics out of the box.

1. **Report Generation**: The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** automates the process of report generation, complete with visualizations that make it easy to analyze and share experiment findings.

1. **Multi-Lingual**: The tool supports language analyzers for linguistic support on individual languages and specialized (language-agnostic) analyzers for user-defined patterns on search indexes. For more information, see [Types of Analyzers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-analyzers#types-of-analyzers).

## Compute setup

At the moment, the RAG Experiment Accelerator runs on a desktop machine. There are two options available; run within a development container or install locally on your host machine.

### 1. Run within a Development Container

Using a development container will mean that all of the required software is installed for you. This will require WSL. For more information about development containers visit [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/)

#### Install the Pre-Requisite Software

Install the following software on the host machine you will perform the deployment from:

>1. For Windows - [Windows Store Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9pn20msr04dw)
>2. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
>3. [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
>4. [Remote-Containers VS Code Extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

#### Developing in a DevContainer

Further guidance of setting up WSL can be found [here](./docs/wsl.md). Now you have the prerequisites, you can:
1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the accelerator's repository in your WSL terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/rag-experiment-accelerator.git
code .
```

Once the project opens in vscode it should ask you if you would like to "Reopen this in a development container". Say yes.

#### Data

Copy your files (in PDF, HTML, Markdown, Text, JSON or DOCX format) into the `data` folder.

---

### 2. Local install

You can of course run the **RAG Experiment Accelerator** on a Windows/Mac machine if you like; you are responsible for installing the correct tooling. Follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the accelerator's repository from [GitHub].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/rag-experiment-accelerator.git
```

2. **setup env file**: Copy `.env.template` and save as `.env` file. Provide values for all the keys

LOGGING_LEVEL is INFO by default. Allowed logging levels are NOTSET, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL.

3. Execute the requirements.txt in a conda (first install Anaconda/Miniconda) or virtual environment (then install a couple of dependencies - prompted on the run) to install the dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n rag-experiment python=3.11
conda init bash
```
Close your terminal, open a new one, and run:
```bash
conda activate rag-experiment
pip install .
```

4. Install Azure CLI and authorize:
```bash
az login
az account set  --subscription="<your_subscription_guid>"
az account show
```

5. Copy your files (in PDF, HTML, Markdown, Text, JSON or DOCX format) into the `data` folder.

## Cloud setup

There are 3 options to install all the required azure services:

### 1. Install with Azure Developer CLI
This project supports Azure Developer CLI.
```sh
azd provision
```
- You can also use `azd up` if you prefer as this calls `azd provision` anyway
- Please use the up/down arrows to select your Subscription and Region

![azd](./docs/azd.png)

Once this has completed you can use the launch configuration to run, or debug the 4 steps and the current environment provisioned by `azd` will be loaded with the correct values.

![alt text](./docs/launch.png)

### 2. One click Azure deployment via Azure portal UI

If you want to deploy the infrastructure yourself from template you can also click here:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Frag-experiment-accelerator%2Fdevelopment%2Finfra%2Fmain.json)

### 3. Deploy with Azure CLI

If you dont want to use `azd` you can use the normal `az` cli too.

```bash
az login
az deployment group create --subscription <subscription-id> --resource-group <resource-group>  --template-file infra/main.bicep
```

> NOTE: When changing the config, remember to change both the `config.sample.json` (the example config to be copied by others) and the [Github actions config file](.github/workflows/config.json) to be used by tests on CI.

## Description of embedding models config

`embedding_models` is an array containing the configuration for the embedding models to use. Embedding model `type` must be `azure` for Azure OpenAI models and `sentence-transformer` for HuggingFace sentence transformer models.

### Azure OpenAI embedding model config

```json
{
    "type": "azure",
    "deployment_name": "the deployment name of the model",
    "dimension": "the dimension of the embedding model. Defaults to 1536 which is the dimension of text-embedding-ada-002"
}
```

### Sentence Transformer embedding model

```json
{
    "type": "sentence-transformer",
    "model_name": "the name of the sentence transformer model",
    "dimension": "the dimension of the model. This field is not required if model name is one of ['all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'all-mpnet-base-v2', 'bert-large-nli-mean-tokens]"
}
```

## Query Expansion

Giving an example of an hypothetical answer for the question in query, an hypothetical passage which holds an answer to the query, or generate few alternative related question might improve retrieval and thus get more accurate chunks of docs to pass into LLM context.
Based on the reference article - [Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels (HyDE - Hypothetical Document Embeddings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496).

The following configuration options turns on this experimantation approachs:


### Generate hypothetical answer for the question in query
```json
{
    "query_expansion": "generated_hypothetical_answer"
}
```

### Generate hypothetical document which includes an answer for the question in query
```json
{
    "query_expansion": "generated_hypothetical_document_to_answer"
}
```

### Generate related question for the question in query

This feature will generate fine related questions, filter out those which are less than `min_query_expansion_related_question_similarity_score` percent from the original query (using cosine similarity score), and search documents for each one of them along with the original query,
deduplicate results and return them to the reranker and top k steps.

default value for `min_query_expansion_related_question_similarity_score` is set to 90%, you may change this in the `config.json`

```json
{
    "query_expansion": "generated_related_questions",
    "min_query_expansion_related_question_similarity_score": 90
}
```

### Pitfalls

This section outlines common gotchas or pitfalls that engineers/developers/data scientists may encounter while working with RAG Experiment Accelerator.

#### Azure Authentication and Authorization

##### Description:
To successfully utilize this solution, you must first authenticate yourself by logging in to your Azure account. This essential step ensures you have the required permissions to access and manage Azure resources used by it. You might errors related to storing QnA data into Azure Machine Learning Data Assets, executing the query and evaluation step as a result of inappropriate authorization and authentication to Azure. Refer to Point 4 in this document for authentication and authorization.

There might be situations in which the solution would still generate errors despite of valid authentication and authorization. In such cases, start a new session with a brand new terminal instance, login to Azure using steps mentioned in step 4 and also check if the user has contribute access to the Azure resources related to the solution.

#### Configuration

##### Description
This solution utilizes several configuration parameters in config.json that directly impact its functionality and performance. Please pay close attention to these settings:

**retrieve_num_of_documents:** This config controls the initial number of documents retrieved for analysis. Excessively high or low values can lead to "index out of range" errors due to rank processing of Search AI results.
**cross_encoder_at_k:** This config influences the ranking process. A high value might result in irrelevant documents being included in the final results.
**llm_re_rank_threshold:** This config determines which documents are passed to the language model (LLM) for further processing. Setting this value too high could create an overly large context for the LLM to handle, potentially leading to processing errors or degraded results. This might also result in exception from Azure OpenAI endpoint.

#### Azure OpenAI Model and Deployment

##### Description
Before running this solution, please ensure you've correctly set up both your Azure OpenAI deployment name within config.json file and add relevant secrets to environment variables (.env file). This information is crucial for the application to connect to the appropriate Azure OpenAI resources and function as designed. If you're unsure about the configuration data, please refer to .env.template and config.json file. The solution has been tested with GPT 3.5 turbo model and needs further tests for any other model.

#### QnA Generation and Querying step

##### Description
During the QnA generation step, you may occasionally encounter errors related to the JSON output received from Azure OpenAI. These errors can prevent the successful generation of few questions and answers. Here's what you need to know:

Possible Causes:

**Incorrect Formatting:** The JSON output from Azure OpenAI may not adhere to the expected format, causing issues with the QnA generation process.
**Content Filtering:** Azure OpenAI has content filters in place. If the input text or generated responses are deemed inappropriate, it could lead to errors.
**API Limitations:** The Azure OpenAI service have token and rate limitations that affect the output.

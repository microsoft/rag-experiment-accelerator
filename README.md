# RAG Experiment Accelerator

## Overview

The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is a versatile tool designed to expedite and facilitate the process of conducting experiments and evaluations using Azure Cognitive Search and RAG pattern. This document offers an extensive guide detailing everything you need to know about this tool, including its purpose, features, installation, usage, and more.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is to streamline and simplify the intricate task of running experiments and evaluations of search queries and quality of response from OpenAI. This tool is valuable for researchers, data scientists, and developers seeking to:

- Assess the performance of diverse Search and OpenAI related hyper-parameters.
- Compare the efficacy of various search strategies.
- Fine-tune and optimize parameters.
- Find the best combination of hyper-parameters.
- Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations from experiment results.

## Features

The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** is config driven and offers a robust array of features to support its purpose:

1. **Experiment Setup**: Users can meticulously define and configure experiments by specifying an array of search engine parameters, search types, query sets, and evaluation metrics.

2. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure Cognitive Search, Azure Machine Learning, MLFlow and Azure OpenAI.

3. **Rich Search Index**: generates multiple search indexes based on hyper-parameter configurations available in config file.

4. **Query Generation**: The tool is equipped with the capability to generate an assortment of diverse, customizable query sets, which can be tailor-made for specific experimentation requirements.

5. **multiple search types**: It supports multiple search types including pure text, pure vector, cross-vector, multi-vector, hybrid plus more empowering users with the capability to conduct comprehensive analysis on seach capabilities and eventual results.

6. **sub-quering**: The pattern evaluates the user query and if it find it complex enough, it would break it down into smalle sub-queries to generate relevant context.

7. **re-ranking**: The query responses from Azure Cognitive Search are re-evaluated using LLM and ranked them according to relevancy between the query and the context.

8. **Metrics and Evaluation**: Users are afforded the liberty to define custom evaluation metrics, thereby enabling precise and granular assessment of search algorithm performance. It includes distance based, cosine, semantic similarity plus more metrics out of the box.

9. **Report Generation**: The **RAG Experiment Accelerator** automates the process of report generation, complete with visually compelling visualizations that facilitate effortless analysis and effortless sharing of experiment findings.


## Installation

To harness the capabilities of the **RAG Experiment Accelerator**, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the accelerator's repository from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/search-experiment-accelerator.git).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/rag-experiment-accelerator.git
```

2. **setup env file**: create .env file at top folder level and provide data for items mentioned:

```bash



AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY=
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_TYPE=
OPENAI_API_VERSION=
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
WORKSPACE_NAME=
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=
LOGGING_LEVEL=

```

LOGGING_LEVEL is INFO by default. Allowed logging levels are NOTSET, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL.
OPENAI_API_TYPE should be either azure if you planning to use Azure, open_ai if you want to use openai or excluded, if none of these required.

3. Execute the requirements.txt in a conda (first install Anaconda/Miniconda) or virtual environment (then install a couple of dependencies - prompted on the run) to install the dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n rag-test python=3.10
conda activate rag-test
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install Azure CLI and authorize:
```bash
az login
az account set  --subscription="<your_subscription_guid>"
az account show
```

5. Copy your `.pdf` files into the `data` folder.

## How to use

To harness the capabilities of the **RAG Experiment Accelerator**, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `search_config.json` file with hyper-parameters relevant to the experiment.
2. Execute `01_index.py` (python 01_index.py) to generate Azure Cognitive Search indexes and ingest data into the indexes.
3. Execute `02_qa_generation.py` (python 02_qa_generation.py) to generate Question-Answer pairs using Azure OpenAI.
4. Execute `03_querying.py` (python 03_querying.py) to query Azure Cognitive Search to generate context, re-ranking items in context and get response from Azure OpenAI using the new context. 
5. Execute `04_evaluation.py` (python 04_evaluation.py)  to calculate metrics using multiple metrics and generate incremental charts and reports in AzureML using MLFLOW integration.

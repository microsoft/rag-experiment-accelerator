1. Simple, factual question
  a. The question is asking for a straightforward fact or piece of information

  c. Breaking the question down further is unlikely to be beneficial
  Examples: "What year did World War 2 end?", "What is the capital of France?, "What is the features of productX?"
2. Complex, multi-part question
  a. The question has multiple distinct components or is asking for information about several related topics
  b. Different parts of the question would likely need to be answered by separate passages or documents
  c. Breaking the question down into sub-questions for each component would allow for better results
  d. The question is open-ended and likely to have a complex or nuanced answer
  e. Answering it may require synthesizing information from multiple sources
  f. The question may not have a single definitive answer and could warrant analysis from multiple angles

question: What can you tell me about albert Albert Einstein?
context: Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 to 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.
answer: Albert Einstein born in 14 March 1879 was  German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics. He published 4 papers in 1905.  Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895

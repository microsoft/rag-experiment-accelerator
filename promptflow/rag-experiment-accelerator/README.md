# **RAG Experiment Accelerator** with Prompt Flow

## Flow description
The RAG Experiment Accelerator is a versatile tool that helps you conduct experiments and evaluations using Azure AI Search and RAG pattern.

The top-level `flow.dag.yaml` runs the rag experiment end-to-end based on the configuration provided in `config.json`.

### Set Up
The `setup` node runs first and loads the required environment variables from a custom connection

### Index
The `index` node will:
- Create indexes based on the paramters set in `config.json`. Each index name will be in the following format: `{name_prefix}-{chunk_size}-{overlap}-{dimension}-{ef_construction}-{ef_search}`
- Chunk documents based on the chunking parameters in `config.json`
- Generate a summary and title for each chunk
- Create embeddings for each chunk's content, generated title, and generated summary
- Uploads the embeddings to Azure AI search Service

If the indexes have been previously created, this node is optional and can be skipped by setting the input `should_index` to `False`.

### QA Generation
The `qa_generation` node will chunk each document and generate ground truth questions and answers for each chunk. 

Optionally, this node can be skipped by setting the input `should_generate_qa` to `false` and a set of user-provided ground truth questions and answers can be used. User-provided questions and answers should be in the `jsonl` file format and by default, in the location `./artifacts/eval_data.jsonl`. This location can be configured by updating the `eval_data_jsonl_file_path` value in `config.json`. Each line of the `jsonl` file should contain the keys:
- `user_prompt` field contains the generated question
- `output_prompt` field contains the generated answer
- `context` field contains the document sections from which the question-answer pair was generated

### Querying
The `querying` node takes the `user_prompt`'s that were generated from the `qa_generation` node and searches Azure AI Search for using the `search_types` specified in `config.json`. 

For each `user_prompt` and `search_type`:
- If the `user_prompt` is complex, it is broken down into multiple prompts and both prompts are used in Azure AI Search
- The search results are optionally reranked based on the `rerank` setting in `config.json`
- Search result metrics are calculated
- The content from the search results are added as context to the `user_prompt` and the LLM is called.
- The responses from the LLM are uploaded as a data asset and used by evaluation node.


### Evaluation
The `evaluation` node takes the results generated by the `querying` node and logs the metrics specified in `config.json` to mlflow. The metrics and configuration parameters can be inspected and compared to past experiments your ML workspace by selecting the `Jobs` tab under `Assets` and clicking on the latest experiment run.

## Getting Started

### VSCode
To run the **RAG Experiment Accelerator** end-to-end in VSCode, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have installed the promptflow extension and pip installed the promptflow and promptflow-tools packages
2. Run: `pip install ./custom_environment/rag_experiment_accelerator-0.9-py3-none-any.whl` 
3. Create a custom connection. See [env_setup](./env_setup.md).

az ml environment create --file ./environment.yaml -w $MLWorkSpaceName
```
2. Create a custom runtime using the newly created environment. See [Create runtime in UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/how-to-create-manage-runtime?view=azureml-api-2#create-runtime-in-ui).
3. Modify the `config.json` file with the hyperparameters for your experiment. Full documentation can be found [here](#description-of-configuration-elements)
4. Create a custom connection. See [env_setup](./env_setup.md).
4. Add your own documents to the `./data` folder. (a set of sample documents are provided for testing purposes)
5. Modify the `config.json` file with the hyperparameters for your experiment. Full documentation on can be found [here](#description-of-configuration-elements)
6. Upload the flow to the ML workspace ![how to upload a local flow](./images/upload_local_flow.png)
7. Select the custom runtime in Prompt Flow
8. Click run in the UI
9. Inspect the results in your ML workspace by selecting the `Jobs` tab under `Assets`. Click on the latest experiment run to view the metrics and results.

## Folder structure

The top-level `flow.dag.yaml` runs the RAG experiments end-to-end and each step can be run independently.

- `data` - the directory for the documents. A set of sample documents are provided for testing
- `custom_environment` - contains the `Dockerfile`, `environment.yaml` and the `rag-experiment-accelerator` `.whl` file. Building an image is necessary when running in Prompt Flow from the ML workspace.
- `images` - contains the images used in this `README.md`

Flows:
- `setup` - (sets the necessary environment variables)
- `index` - (contains the `index` flow)
- `qa_generation`- (contains the `qa_generation` flow)
- `querying`- (contains the `querying` flow)
- `evaluation` - (contains the `evaluation` flow)

Each step can also be run independently and the flow is contained in its corresponding folder. When running the flows independently, an initial `setup` will run to ensure the proper environment variables are set.

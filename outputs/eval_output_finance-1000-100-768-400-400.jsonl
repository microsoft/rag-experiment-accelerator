{"query_type": "search_for_manual_hybrid", "actual": "The push towards alternative-fuel vehicles poses a credit challenge for multiple sectors in Japan, particularly for Japan Inc. The credit impact on Japan Inc. is weighted to the negative because of the challenges facing the large auto sector, and the direct impact on sectors such as steel and refining. Lower gasoline consumption will also reduce a meaningful source of government tax revenue, which could be negative for many Japanese sectors. The shift toward alternative-fuel vehicles presents significant challenges to Japan Inc. particularly because of the pressures on the dominant auto industry and the negative impact on sectors such as steel and refining, as well as an indirect ripple effect on others such as the regional and local governments. The more immediate risk is the need to increase investments in an array of technologies and new businesses that may not produce an appropriate return for a while, if ever. Some sectors stand to lose if demand for their products or services declines because of electric vehicles and emerging mobility trends, such as ride-sharing.

Firstly, R&D costs and capital investment will increase, but the return is uncertain.

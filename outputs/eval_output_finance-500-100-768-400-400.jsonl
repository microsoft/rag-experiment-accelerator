{"query_type": "search_for_manual_hybrid", "actual": "Automakers may face potential challenges such as squeezed margins due to increased R&D costs and capital investment, uncertain returns, increased competition from new carmakers, and the need to develop new business models. Additionally, emerging technologies may take automakers beyond their core competencies. The scale and speed at which such vehicles may be taken up also pose risks for automakers and their suppliers. According to the Moody's Investors Service report, the ramping up of alternative-fuel vehicles may squeeze automakers' already thin margins. Rising R&D costs and capital investment needed to transition from conventional gasoline-engine vehicles to alternative-fuel vehicles may increase, but the return is uncertain. In addition, the entry of new carmakers increases competition, while emerging technologies take automakers beyond their core competencies and toward new business models.

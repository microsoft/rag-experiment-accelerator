{"user_prompt":"What are the potential challenges that automakers may face with the ramping up of alternative-fuel vehicles?","output_prompt":"Automakers may face challenges such as increased R&D costs and capital investment, uncertain returns, competition from new carmakers, and the need to develop new business models.","context":"\u00bbRamping up of alternative-fuel vehicles may squeeze automakers' already thin\nmargins.  R&D costs and capital investment will increase, but the return is uncertain. In\naddition, the entry of new carmakers increases competition, while emerging technologies\ntake automakers beyond their core competencies and toward new business models.\n\u00bbGrowth in alternative-fuel vehicles, however, will create new demand for\nelectronics, chemicals and integrated-utility companies . Demand for new electric\ndevices, motor and battery-related businesses will play to the technological strengths\nof some electronics and chemical companies, and for others, offset the revenue declines\nin their mature products. Chemical companies that manufacture components used\nin lithium-ion batteries will benefit from increased demand. Incremental demand for\nelectricity to charge vehicles will partly mitigate a demand decline from a shrinking\npopulation, energy conservation and customer losses from deregulation.\n\u00bbEffect on auto-parts suppliers is mixed.  Suppliers of parts related to conventional\ngasoline engines will see a large decline in demand. But companies that provide essential\nparts to leading global automakers, such as glass, tires and air-conditioning units, will see\nlittle effect.\n\u00bbSteel-makers face potential reduction in demand and more competition.  Steel, the\nkey material in automaking, will face increased competition from aluminum and carbon\nfiber as automakers seek lighter-weight options to offset the weight of an electric battery.\n\u00bbMore alternative-fuel vehicles will exacerbate already falling demand refiners\nare seeing for gasoline.  The steady decline in refined oil demand will accelerate with an\nincrease in fuel-efficient vehicles and a decrease in Japan's driving population."}

Over the next decade, Japanese auto manufacturers and associated\nindustries, which we refer to as Japan Inc., will make sizable upfront investments in\nalternative-fuel vehicle technologies while bearing risks around the scale and speed of this\nvehicle take-up. The risks of miscalculating this transition are substantial.\n\u00bbElectrification will have widespread effects on key industries.  The credit impact\non Japan Inc. is weighted to the negative because of the challenges facing the large\nauto sector, and the direct impact on sectors such as steel and refining. Lower gasoline\nconsumption will also reduce a meaningful source of government tax revenue, which\nfunds road construction and public works programs."}
{"user_prompt":"What are the potential challenges that automakers may face with the ramping up of alternative-fuel vehicles?","output_prompt":"Automakers may face challenges such as increased R&D costs and capital investment, uncertain returns, competition from new carmakers, and the need to develop new business models.","context":"\u00bbRamping up of alternative-fuel vehicles may squeeze automakers' already thin\nmargins.  R&D costs and capital investment will increase, but the return is uncertain. In\naddition, the entry of new carmakers increases competition, while emerging technologies\ntake automakers beyond their core competencies and toward new business models.\n\u00bbGrowth in alternative-fuel vehicles, however, will create new demand for\nelectronics, chemicals and integrated-utility companies . Demand for new electric\ndevices, motor and battery-related businesses will play to the technological strengths\nof some electronics and chemical companies, and for others, offset the revenue declines\nin their mature products. Chemical companies that manufacture components used\nin lithium-ion batteries will benefit from increased demand. Incremental demand for\nelectricity to charge vehicles will partly mitigate a demand decline from a shrinking\npopulation, energy conservation and customer losses from deregulation.\n\u00bbEffect on auto-parts suppliers is mixed.  Suppliers of parts related to conventional\ngasoline engines will see a large decline in demand. But companies that provide essential\nparts to leading global automakers, such as glass, tires and air-conditioning units, will see\nlittle effect.\n\u00bbSteel-makers face potential reduction in demand and more competition.  Steel, the\nkey material in automaking, will face increased competition from aluminum and carbon\nfiber as automakers seek lighter-weight options to offset the weight of an electric battery.\n\u00bbMore alternative-fuel vehicles will exacerbate already falling demand refiners\nare seeing for gasoline.  The steady decline in refined oil demand will accelerate with an\nincrease in fuel-efficient vehicles and a decrease in Japan's driving population."}
{"user_prompt":"What percentage of total unit sales in Japan are expected to be accounted for by alternative-fuel vehicles by 2030?","output_prompt":"About 60% of total unit sales in Japan are expected to be accounted for by alternative-fuel vehicles by 2030.","context":"account for about 60% of total unit sales in Japan by 2030, with BEVs representing roughly 10%. Nonetheless, Japanese automakers\nneed to adapt to trends in global markets given domestic sales account for only 10%-20% of total unit sales.\nAt the same time, one of the biggest risks is of the uncertainty in the forecasting itself, which makes it very challenging for automakers\nto adopt a strategy that ensures they remain competitive and profitable. The speed of adoption of renewable power, for example, has\nconsistently exceeded forecasts and the same could occur with BEVs (Exhibit 2).\nThis publication does not announce a credit rating action.
